String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap .  It is just like object allocation. By default, it is empty and privately maintained by the Java String
class. Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory. 

example: 

String name = " raj";
String name1 =  "raj ;
if ( name== name1){
System.out.println(" they are equal" );
}
else
System.out.println(" not equal" );

output:
they are equal 

Reason :
 although they are having diffirent names , still their memory allocation in the heap memory is same. Because they carring same characters.
